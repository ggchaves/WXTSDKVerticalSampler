You need to log into apple as a developer. Instructions are simple to follow if your AppleID is not a developer account yet. 
- Extract the XCode executable from the .xip file by opening the .xip archive. 
- If you already have a newer version of XCode, then copy the xCode file from the archive into a different folder than Applications so you do not overwrite the newer xCode. Filenames are the same so you have to extract the file info to verify the version number.
